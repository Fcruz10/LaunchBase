## ✔ About
Creating a server that has two routes that must return the content of the html generated in challenge 2-3 (pages of Courses and About). In addition, a standard file (layout.njk) should be implemented that reuses the code in common between these two and also a file that serves a 404 error page.
<p><i>Error 404 is common to appear on internet pages, when no content was found.</i></p>
